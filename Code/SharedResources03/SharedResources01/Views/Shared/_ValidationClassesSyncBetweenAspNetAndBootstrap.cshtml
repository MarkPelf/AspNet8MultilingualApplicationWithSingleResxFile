@* _ValidationClassesSyncBetweenAspNetAndBootstrap.cshtml===================== *@
@*
All this is to sync Asp.Net CSS error classes with Bootstrap CSS classes to
mark error input elements border to red by Bootstrap.

Asp.Net will add CSS class .input-validation-error to form a field with an error.
But, Bootstrap does not know what to do with that CSS class, so that class
needs to be mapped to CSS class that Bootstrap understands, and that is
CSS class .is-invalid.

That is the purpose of this JavaScript code that is here. Of course, we hook
to DOMContentLoaded event and do the mapping of CSS classes.

The final result is that the red line on the form control marking an invalid field.

<script type="text/javascript">
    window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
        document.querySelectorAll("input.input-validation-error")
            .forEach((elem) => { elem.classList.add("is-invalid"); }
            );
    });
</script>
